# Daily Goals - Productivity Apps

**Dails Goals** is generally an app for people to "rebahan".

Or the cool language is An App that helps to **increase daily productivity** by organizing the goals and activities by providing a personal assistant to help manage their daily activities wisely.

This app is proposed to be used as **Nano Challenge 1** in **Apple Developer Academy** and the roadmap of development process only takes **5 days**:
- 1 day --> brainstorming the problem until the solution concept
- 1.5 days -> visualize the solution concept for Low-Fi and Hi-Fi
- 2 days -> code and manual testing 
- 0.5 days -> receiving feedback from others
